# pokemon-identifier

## Context
The dataset was built out of necessity as there was not much sanitised data available online for images of Pokemon based on their
Generation and names.

This dataset aims at solving this problem, all the images of Pokemons are separated based on folders with names of Pokemon so that it's easy for the user to run a training algorithm on it.

## Content
The dataset contains 151 folders, one for each gen 1 pokemon and each folder contains 60 image for every pokemon.
In all there are over 10,000+ images

## Acknowledgements
This wouldn't have been possible without the awesome linux guru @Prajjwal who helped me in scraping the data and cleaning it up.
